# Most of the loops you'll write in CoffeeScript will be comprehensions 
# over arrays, objects, and ranges. Comprehensions replace (and compile 
# into) for loops, with optional guard clauses and the value of the 
# current array index. Unlike for loops, array comprehensions are 
# expressions, and can be returned and assigned.
